# quinquaginta-duo Â· [![npm version][npm badge]][npm url]

This package provides the implementation of boolean vectors (masks) used by
[JScrewIt](https://github.com/fasttime/JScrewIt) to represent features.
It is named after the word for the number fifty-two in Latin, which is the maximum number of
boolean elements that masks can handle in this implementation.

## Overview

A mask is an immutable, transparent data structure used to operate on multiple boolean values at
once.
Masks should only be accessed using the mask functions provided by quinquaginta-duo.
No other functions or operators should be ever used with a mask.
Do not make any assumptions about the internal representation of masks, their type or truthiness.
For performance reasons, mask functions do not validate their parameters.

## Compatibility

The same JavaScript engines supported by the latest version of JScrewIt are supported by
quinquaginta-duo.
